Are males perhaps taller or wider? In this chapter, you are going to scientifically compare two groups of measurements. 6.1 Getting Started The first step is to correctly read your data into the software: If you havent already, install RStudio; Download the data. If it is an Excel (.xlsx) file, open it in Excel and save as CSV; Open RStudio and create a new R markdown file. Save this file to the same folder as the data! Go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location. R now knows where to locate your data; Create a new code chunk and run the following: Sepia &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Sepia.csv&quot;) From here on out, just read the text, run the code in R, adjust the R code if needed, and answer the questions. Note: For the sake of privacy, this page uses an old version of the data with scrambled names. I have also not linked the actual data. Please ask an assistant if you are unable to find it. If the code ran successfully, you will have an object called Sepia in your workspace. You can view it by clicking it, or by running: View(Sepia) Rather than type long names throughout the analysis, lets make the variable names a bit shorter: colnames(Sepia) &lt;- c(&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Affix&quot;, &quot;Surname&quot;, &quot;Group&quot;, &quot;Length&quot;, &quot;Width&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;) Does R understand which variables are numbers and which are something else? Lets check: str(Sepia) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 200 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Name : chr &quot;naFan&quot; &quot;llEl&quot; &quot;MeMe&quot; &quot;eueort&quot; ... ## $ Affix : chr &quot;van&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;de&quot; ... ## $ Surname: chr &quot;RmesoasR&quot; &quot;aBBa&quot; &quot;Kunenn&quot; &quot;yuyyn&quot; ... ## $ Group : chr &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; ... ## $ Length : int 13 10 13 15 11 13 15 10 12 15 ... ## $ Width : int 94 79 78 80 84 68 100 75 87 90 ... ## $ Sex : chr &quot;man&quot; &quot;man&quot; &quot;man&quot; &quot;vrouw&quot; ... Question: Is the data read correctly into R? How can you tell? What do you think chr and int mean? 6.2 Plotting the Data Just looking at code and numbers is a bit stale. So lets start off by making some relevant plots: par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Plot in a 2x2 grid hist(Sepia$Length, col = &quot;lightgray&quot;) hist(Sepia$Width, col = &quot;lightgray&quot;) plot(Length ~ Width, data = Sepia, col = factor(Sex)) boxplot(Width ~ Sex, data = Sepia, col = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Restore the default Question: What does each plot show? Can you change the code to make different plots? (You can try changing the variable names, or change the graphical parameters.) 6.3 Creating a Subset We just read the whole data set. It contains the data from all groups Lets make a subset of the measurements performed by group A: Subset &lt;- Sepia[Sepia$Group == &quot;A&quot;, ] What does this code do? Subset &lt;-: Create a variable named Subset; Sepia[x, y]: From the data set Sepia, select only rows x and columns y. If y is left blank, it selects all columns;1 Sepia$Groep == \"A\": From the data set Sepia, select the variable Group and check if it is equal to the value A (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Question: Can you change the code to make a subset of your own group? (Skip this if you happen to be in A.) Make two more subsets called Male and Female, which contain only the measurements of their respective sex. (Optional) Using R code, can you make a subset that contains only the male measurements, and only of your group? 6.4 T-test How do we compare measurements of two groups? One way to do that is through a \\(t\\)-test. To choose the right \\(t\\)-test, you should understand five choices: Do you need a one-sample, or two-sample \\(t\\)-test? Do you want to test one-sided or two-sided? Is it reasonable to assume equal variance? Are the measurements independent or paired? Is the underlying assumption of normality reasonable? Do you remember all of those choices? Is so, impressive! If not, you can rewatch the video version of the lecture here: 6.4.1 Example Below is an example of a \\(t\\)-test, using some standard data in R: t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep, alternative = &quot;less&quot;, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: extra by group ## t = -1.8608, df = 18, p-value = 0.03959 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is less than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -Inf -0.1076222 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group 1 mean in group 2 ## 0.75 2.33 This particular \\(t\\)-test is a one-sided \\(t\\)-test for equal variance. The output shows that the mean of group 1 is \\(0.75\\) hours of extra sleep, while the mean of group 2 is \\(2.33\\). The \\(p\\)-value for this test is \\(0.0396\\). If we use a level of significance of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), then group 2 is has a significantly larger mean than group 1, because \\(0.0396 &lt; 0.05\\). 6.4.2 Exercise Question: Watch the video below and choose a \\(t\\)-test you deem appropriate for: Comparing male and female length; Comparing male and female width. (They could be the same, just explain briefly why you chose a certain \\(t\\)-test.) Question: Perform the tests you chose for (1) and (2) in R and draw a conclusion. Have a look at how the example was coded using the data argument and adjust it to make it work for the data of your group (Subset). You may use the same level of significance \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Compare your results with at least one other group. If your conclusion differs, can you explain why? Did we now prove that Sepia males and females differ in physical dimensions? Did we prove they are the same? What is the right way to express the conclusion? (Optional) You performed two tests. That means that both can result in a false positive. With \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), what is the chance of at least one false positive when performing two tests?
