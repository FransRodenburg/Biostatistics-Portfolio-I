Proof is irrefutable. There exists no triangle where this does not hold. The same cannot be said for evidence: () In biology, conclusions are largely based on observations and experiments, rather than proof. This has a crucial implication for biological research: There is always uncertainty in your conclusion. Statistics is about understanding and expressing that uncertainty. Study design is the subfield of statistics concerned with minimizing the sources of uncertainty that are inherent to your experiments. 5.2 Formulating a Research Question 5.2.1 Types of research questions Confirmatory, inferential, predictive, exploratory. 5.2.2 Keep it simple A simple experimental design can be analyzed with simple statistical analysis. Here are some tips to keep your design simple: Have a quick look at the previous chapters. Design your experiment around a type of research question you are already familiar with; Try to use representative sampling, randomized treatment allocation and a balanced design; If you are going to compare groups, limit the number of groups. If you compare every group to every other group, then very quickly, you will end up with a very large number of comparisons: Table 5.1: The number of possible comparisons for 210 groups.
