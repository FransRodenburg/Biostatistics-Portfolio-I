[["index.html", "Biostatistics Portfolio I Preface", " Biostatistics Portfolio I Â© 2020 Dr. F.J. Rodenburg Preface Teaching statistics to students of the life sciences is a challenge: The courses are usually too short, with too much time in between them; Too many skills are introduced at once (math, programming and statistics); The connection to other courses is not clear enough. This is what I aim to address through this portfolio. You should complete the chapters leading up to your first statistics course. Part II will then pick up where your first course (presumably) left off and is meant to bridge the gap between your first statistics course and the next. Figure 0.1: The knowledge that is usually either assumed to be known already, or introduced briefly at that start of your first statistics course, will be introduced gradually throughout this portfolio.1 Chapters are short, have overlap with each other, and are accompanied with explanatory videos. This is not meant to be a cumbersome addition to your already intensive education, it is merely meant to reduce the difficulty of statistics courses. Expert knowledge is what you learn during your other courses. Many choices in statistics are driven by knowledge of the subject area (e.g. biology). This holds especially true for study design and model selection. "],["installation.html", "Chapter 1 Installation 1.1 Installation Guide 1.2 Understanding the RStudio interface", " Chapter 1 Installation Throughout this portfolio, I will use RStudio. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio. 1.1 Installation Guide If youre comfortable with computer software, it boils down to: Install R; Install RStudio; Open RStudio and try to knit a template R markdown file. If you cant knit to PDF, see the note below and try knitting to HTML instead. Note about TinyTeX TinyTeX is not required for this portfolio. If you want to knit to PDF, you have to install TinyTeX. This has several advantages over HTML and Word, which are explained in the second video. For the portfolio, all you need is a working version of RStudio, and to be able to knit to HTML. Note about installation problems in general I want to help you with a smooth experience using this portfolio, but the only way we can do so is by addressing installation issues early on. If youre following this portfolio in the context of your biology education at Leiden University, you can always contact Dr. van Mil or me about installation issues. Otherwise, see the general tips below, or try asking a question on Stackoverflow. Some general tips that will save you a lot of headaches with software during your education: Setting your system language to English (Windows, Mac) makes everything a lot easier to find; If you store data in Excel, setting the decimal separator to a dot (.) instead of a comma (,) will also save you a lot of extra effort; If you are on Windows, I highly recommend working on an account with administrator rights and setting user account control to Never notify. (Link says Windows 7 &amp; 8, but it works the same for Windows 10.) 1.2 Understanding the RStudio interface Watch the video on the RStudio interface below. From here on I will assume that you have seen it. "],["figures-placeholder.html", "Chapter 2 Figures (placeholder) 2.1 Inserting an image from a file 2.2 Adding plots", " Chapter 2 Figures (placeholder) This chapter is under construction In this chapter you will learn how to insert a figure in an R markdown file. You can use this chapter as future reference for when you want to include figures in later chapters. 2.1 Inserting an image from a file The simplest way to include a figure is by writing anywhere outside code chunks: ![description](path/to/image.extension) This method is fine when you just want to include an image and dont care about anything else. For example, the main folder of the portfolio (bookdown) contains a subfolder figures with an example image called pollenSEM.jpg. Writing ![Some description](figures/pollenSEM.jpg) will include the image with a caption: An image of pollen under an SEM. From: https://w.wiki/gv8 2.1.1 Exercise 1 Copy a different image to the bookdown/figures folder and include it here using the code shown above: Answer [remove this line and add your own code] For greater flexibility, include figures within code chunks using include_graphics(). For example: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/pollenSEM.jpg&quot;) Figure 2.1: An image of pollen under an SEM. From: https://w.wiki/gv8 See the .Rmd file for the chunk options used. You can set echo = FALSE if you dont want to show the code in the portfolio. Adding a caption with the fig.cap argument automatically numbers the image. In addition, it allows for cross-referencing, using \\@ref(fig:...). Simply replace ... with the label you wrote for the chunk containing the image. For example: Figure 2.1. 2.1.2 Exercise 2 Insert your figure from exercise 1 with a smaller size, using a new code chunk. You can copy the chunk above as a starting point, but beware that there cannot be two chunks with the same name, so change pollen to something else. Answer: [remove this line and add your own code in an R chunk] Then, add a sentence below the chunk referencing the image using \\@ref(fig:...). [remove this line and add a sentence referencing your image.] 2.2 Adding plots Of course, you can also include plots generated by R code. Below is a simple example: 2.2.1 Simple example (plot of a linear relationship) x &lt;- 1:10 y &lt;- -5 + 2 * x plot(y ~ x, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;Linear Relationship&quot;) Figure 2.2: A linear relationship 2.2.2 Multiple plots in one area You can also add multiple plots to a single plotting area: Figure 2.3: Four variables of the iris data set plotted against each other. Here I used par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) to create a grid of 2 by 3 plots. (Note how the code is suppressed from the final document, by setting echo = FALSE.) 2.2.3 Exercise 3 The code below generates data for a logarithmic, exponential and quadratic relationship. Use par(mfrow = c(..., ...)) to arrange these plots side by side. Figure 2.4: From left to right: A logarithmic, exponential and quadratic relationship. Figure 2.5: From left to right: A logarithmic, exponential and quadratic relationship. Figure 2.6: From left to right: A logarithmic, exponential and quadratic relationship.
